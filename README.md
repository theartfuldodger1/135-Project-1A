String and File Operations

This program accepts user input of a sentence with a minimum of 3 words 
and a maximum of 4. The words are converted to lower case and checked against
as many as four files as required for one of four catagories: nouns, verbs,
pronouns and adjectives. The order of the types of words is expected to fit
any of 5 structures:
1. <noun><verb><noun>
2. <noun><verb><adjective><noun>
3. <pronoun><verb><noun>
4. <verb><adjective><noun>
5. <pronoun><verb><pronoun>
Successful matches of input word groups that are in an order that fits one of the 
above 'grammatical' structures triggers print to console statement of successfully
matched  words and the grammatical structure the ordered words match. The program 
is then exited. Any failure to fit ordered words with one of the above or failure 
to find a match from any appropriate list causes a print to console statement that 
reflects the failure and program is exited.
